Design & Development Guidelines

🔹 Visual Excellence: Every design request must be visually stunning, unique, and production-ready—avoid generic layouts. Webpages must have smooth interactions and a polished user experience.

🔹 Frontend Stack:

Use JSX + Tailwind CSS for styling.
Use React hooks for logic.
Use Lucide React for all icons.
❌ Do not install additional UI libraries or icon packs unless explicitly requested.
🔹 Media & Assets:

Use Unsplash for stock images.
Embed images using direct URLs in <img> tags—do not download or store them locally.
🔹 Database & Backend:

Supabase (PostgreSQL-based): Follow strict PostgreSQL syntax and best practices for all queries and database interactions.
Fixing Migrations: If a policy exists, drop it first before fixing errors in migrations.
🔹 Code Quality & Best Practices:

No redundant code—avoid repeating declarations, export statements, or unnecessary definitions.
Clear & optimized logic—no undefined or unused parameters.
Simplicity over complexity—keep logic straightforward and efficient.
